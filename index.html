            <p class="text-muted text-left">Cybercrime is a type of crime invlving a computer or a computer network. The computer may have been used in committing the crime, or it may be the target. Cybercrome may harm someone's security or finances</p>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">Internationally, both state and nono-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrime crossing international borders and involing the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwelfare. Warren Buffett has said that cybercrime is the "number one problem with mankind" and that it "poses real risks to humanity".</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system.[15] Computer fraud that involves the use of the internet is also called internet fraud. The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction, but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence. For example, in the case of United States v. Neil Scott Kramer, the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual ยง2G1.3(b)(3) for his use of a cell phone to "persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct." Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term "computer" means "an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device."</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims for such purposes as coerced prostitution or the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam. Victims are abducted, threatened, or deceived and transferred to "cybersex dens". The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer, tablet, or phone with an internet connection. Perpetrators use social media networks, video conferences, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites, and other platforms. They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities. Millions of reports of cybersex incidents are sent to authorities annually. New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this type of cybercrime.</p>
